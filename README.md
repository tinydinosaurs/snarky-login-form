# Welcome to Snarky Login Form

Have you ever wanted a form that you could always log into no matter what email and password combination you used? Did you want that form to take you to the least informative page possible? Did you want to be mocked if you tried signing up or getting password help?

Cool, this is the log in form for you.

## But Seriously

I got laid off after 8 years at **REDACTED** (hey former employer, feel free to hire me back ðŸ™‚). I want to keep my skills fresh. I also haven't created or contributed to Github repos much in those 8 years, because frankly I wanted to do things other than write code when I wasn't at work.

I did this project because I haven't built a form -- any kind of form -- from scratch in just forever. I figured it'd be a good exercise, and it was. I learned about Vite, and I got my feet wet with Tailwind.

## Tools and Such

-   React + Typescript
-   Vite
-   pnpm
-   React Router
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Local storage
-   Validation without a library

## Next Steps

-   Add some tests
-   Create a sign up process
-   Authenticate
-   Add Github actions to run tests on PRs
-   Deploy somewhere or other

## Run This App!

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

You should be able to log in with a valid email address and a password that's 16 characters minimum. Play around. Have fun.
